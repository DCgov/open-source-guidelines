DC Government open source code and content should be provided with the least restriction possible. This means avoiding constraints on how, when, or by whom code may be repurposed. Requirements for attribution should be avoided.

The following open source license and contributing texts should be applied to DC government open source projects, except where a compelling need for other provisions exists. When the project contains work performed by a contractor, ensure that copyright is either held by the District or that the contractor applies the same license to their contributions.
