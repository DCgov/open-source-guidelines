title: "Joining the Pilot"

Any team in DC government can join the open source pilot. The Technology Innovation Program is here to support you and your team in learning the tools and techniques you need to be successful.

To join the pilot or learn more, please [email us](mailto:opensource@dc.gov).  We're excited to help!

### Setting Up a GitHub Account

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a free web service built on top of the open source versioning tool Git. 

Start out by [creating a free Github account](https://github.com/join). If you have used GitHub in the past and already have an account set up, there is no need to open a new one. Just use some common sense to ensure that your username and avatar are work appropriate. 

As an added layer of security, you should [enable two-factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/security), or 2FA. More information on 2FA is available [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).

A good getting started guide for Github is available [here](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/03/how-to-use-github-and-the-terminal-a-guide/) and a hands on tutorial can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

### Joining DCgov on GitHub

[DCgov](https://github.com/dcgov) is the home for DC Government projects on Github.  Any DC government employee or contractor is encouraged to become a member by setting up a Github account and requesting access to the DCgov organization.

To join the [DCgov](https://github.com/dcgov) organization on Github, send [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov) an email containing your GitHub username from your official DC Government email address.

Once you're added to the organization, join the relevant project or agency team by requesting access from each team's maintainer. If there is no team that meets your needs, feel free to create a new one. All teams should have a self-explanatory name, a brief description, and be marked visible.

Team members may be granted read, write, or administrative permissions to their team's repositories.  

Individuals other than DC Government staff and contractors may be added as 'outside collaborators' to individual repositories on a case-by-case basis and with confirmation from [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov)

For more information on permissions management, see [the policy]("{{ site.baseurl }}/permissions/").
