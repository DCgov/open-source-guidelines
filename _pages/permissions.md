### Who can be added as a member the DCgov GitHub organization?
* Both DC Government civil service staff and authorized contractors may be added as organization members. To join, they must email their GitHub username to [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov) from their official DC Government email address.  Users are not required to create a new, dedicated Github account for their government work.
* Non-DC Government staff, unauthorized contractors, and members of the public may not be added as organization member. However, they may be added to repositories as 'outside collaborators' on a case-by-case basis and with approval from [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov).

### What permissions do members have?
* By default, organization members have read only permissions to the organization's repositories (can clone and pull all repositories).
* Members may create new teams for their agency or project if a relevant team does not already exist. All teams should be publicly visible, unless otherwise permitted by [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov).
* Members may create new repositories and add teams to those repositories. All repositories should be public, unless otherwise permitted by [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov).
* Teams may be granted read, write, or admin permissions to a repository at the discretion of the repository owner(s).

### To be explored through the pilot
* How do we efficiently remove access permissions from users when they leave employment or their role changes?
