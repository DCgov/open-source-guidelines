title:  "Managing Teams"
---

The DC Government Open Source Program Pilot uses a flexible permissions model. Agency teams have full control of their projects and the access levels of their team members.  

Permissions on Github are managed using Organizations, Teams, and Repositories.  DC Government uses a single organization with as many teams as needed to provide privileged access to its repositories.  This approach makes it easy for the public to browse and contribute to DC's open source projects while maintaining the autonomy of individual teams.


### Who can be added as a member the DCgov GitHub organization?
DC Government employees and contractors can be added as organization members. To join, they must email their GitHub username to [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov) from their official DC Government email address.  

Members of the public may not be added as organization member. However, they may be added to repositories as 'outside collaborators' on a case-by-case basis.

### What permissions do members have?

Being added as a member of the DCgov organization allows a user to create new repositories and teams in the organization.  It does not not allow them to alter existing repositories owned by other teams in the organization.

Teams can be granted read, write, or admin permissions to a repository at the discretion of the repository owners.  Members of the organization are added to teams by team owners.

Members can create new teams for their agency or project if a relevant team does not already exist. All teams should be publicly visible.
