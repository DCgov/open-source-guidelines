title:  "Working in the Open"
---

We strongly believe in working in the open. Doing so leads to a better end-product by: encouraging collaboration within and outside of DC government, promoting a positive work atmosphere, and compelling us to thoughtfully review for issues and document what we create.

This page lays out several scenarios and provides a 'fast track' checklist to help your team work well in the open. If you and/or your supervisor have doubts regarding any checklist item, it is likely a signal that a more extensive review process may be warranted.

### Scenario 1: I want to fork a third-party GitHub repository for use in a DC Government project

- I understand the terms under which the source repository is licensed.
- I have determined that the source repository's license permits modification and re-use.


### Scenario 2: I want to publish an existing DC Government project to GitHub

- I have removed all personally identifiable information (PII), including private keys, tokens, passwords, IP addresses, and other authentication information.
- I have determined that the license(s) and contract(s) governing the project's contents permit their public release and that there are no licensing conflicts.
- I have included a README with a clear project description. If applicable, these include installation instructions that have been tested on a clean machine.
- I have included a LICENSE that describes how the project is licensed and notes the presence of third-party code with different license requirements.
- Multiple contributors have ensured that the above steps are followed.
- I have sent an email to [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov), laying out the repository's proposed content and received confirmation.


### Scenario 3: I want to push or pull commits to an existing DCgov GitHub repository

- I have removed all personally identifiable information (PII), including private keys, tokens, passwords, IP addresses, and other authentication information.
- My commits' contents are allowed to be released under the repository's existing license.


### Scenario 4: I want to use GitHub to work on a new project in the open

- I have confirmed that the repository's contents will be publicly releasable under an open license.
- I have determined that the project poses no undue risk to DC Government staff or infrastructure, or to District residents.
- Multiple contributors have ensured that the above steps are followed.
- I have sent an email to [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov) laying out the repository's proposed content and received confirmation.


### Scenario 5: I want to use GitHub to work on a new project in a private repository

Creating private repositories within DCgov is discouraged. If you believe you have a valid reason to do so, send an email explaining the repository's proposed contents and your explanation to [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov).
