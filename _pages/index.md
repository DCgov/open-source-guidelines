##Welcome! 

These are draft guidelines for using and working on open source code in DC Government. They are being developed as part of a pilot program launched by the Office of Technology and Innovation in the [Office of the Chief Technology Officer](http://octo.dc.gov).

This is a living document, which we are using in our own work. We welcome collaboration, participation, and feedback from teams across DC government as we scale the program. 

If you would like to find out more, please reach out to [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov). You can also propose edits to the guidelines [here](https://github.com/dcgov/open-source-guidelines).
