The District is moving toward a policy of "open by default." This means that unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise, we intend to:

* Use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), which is software that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code, in our projects and contribute back to the open source community.
* Develop our work in the open.
* Publish publicly all source code created or modified by DC Government agencies, whether developed in-house by government staff or through contracts negotiated by those agencies.

Currently, abiding by the second two points requires going through a rigorous security and privacy review process.

This page lays out several scenarios and provides a  'fast track' checklist to help your team accelerate the review process in cases where the security risk is low.

### Scenario 1: I want to fork a third-party GitHub repository for use in a DC Government project

- [ ] I understand the terms under which the source repository is licensed.

### Scenario 2: I want to publish an existing DC Government project to GitHub

- [ ] I have removed all private keys, tokens, passwords, and other authentication information.
- [ ] I have removed all personally identifiable information (PII).
- [ ] I have determined that the license(s) governing the project's contents permit(s) their public release.
- [ ] I have sent an email to opensource@dc.gov, laying out the repository's proposed content and received confirmation.

### Scenario 3: I want to use GitHub to work on a new project in the open
