## Welcome!

The District is piloting a new program to promote the use and development of open source code within its agencies. The aim is to establish a shared home and governance model for all DC Government open source projects, with enough flexibility to support diverse agency and project needs.

The program will enable agencies to:

* Develop their work in the open, enabling public feedback and collaboration from day one.
* Use open source software developed by third parties.
* Contribute to open source projects maintained by third parties.

Based on the results of the Open Source Pilot, a more formal open source policy will be developed and launched in the coming months.

All DC Government teams are welcome to take part in the Pilot, with this site designed to give you the know-how to join in.

The site itself is a living document, actively maintained by the [Office of the Chief Technology Officer](http://octo.dc.gov) Technology Innovation Program. We welcome feedback and edits from teams across DC government and the public as we scale the program.
