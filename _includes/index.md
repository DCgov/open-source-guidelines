Welcome! These are draft guidelines for the use and creation of open source code in DC Government.  Currently these guidelines are in use as part of a pilot program launched by the Technology and Innovation team at OCTO.  

We're using these guidelines ourselves and welcome participation from development teams across DC government. The goal is to scale involvement in the program to include as many projects, teams, and agencies as possible over time. If your team would like to find out more or participate, please reach out to [opensource@dc.gov](opensource@dc.gov).

Please take a look around and contribute your thoughts and questions.
