##Welcome! 
The District is piloting a coordinated approach to open source development. The goal is to establish a shared home, governance, and styleguide for all agencies' open source projects, with enough flexibility to support diverse agency and project needs. 

The open source program will enable agencies to:

* Use open source software developed by third parties.
* Contribute code to open source projects maintained by third parties.
* Develop our work in the open, enabling public feedback and collaboration from day one.

Based on the results of the pilot, formal policy and expanded guidance will be developed and the open source program will be officially launched in the coming months.


### About this site
These are draft guidelines for using and working on open source code in DC Government. They are being actively developed as part of a pilot program launched by the [Office of the Chief Technology Officer](http://octo.dc.gov) Technology Innovation Program. 

This is a living document. We welcome feedback and edits from teams across DC government and the public as we scale the program.
