The District is piloting a open source development through its innovation program, Office of the Chief Technology Officer, and partner agencies.  This guide is designed to help those participating in the pilot get up to speed and use open source technologies in a consistent way.  The pilot will gradually be expanded, this guide and other policy/process materials will be refined and expanded, and then a proper Open Source program will be launched.  The pilot and eventual program will enable DC Government to:

* Use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), which is software that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code, in our projects and contribute back to the open source community.
* Develop our work in the open.
* Publish publicly all source code created or modified by DC Government agencies, whether developed in-house by government staff or through contracts negotiated by those agencies.

To help foster this shift, we have created [DCgov](https://github.com/dcgov) as the home for DC Government projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Any DC government staff member or authorized contractor with a GitHub account can (and is encouraged to) become a member.

### Setting Up a GitHub Account

Start out by [creating a free account](https://github.com/join) on GitHub. If you have used GitHub in the past and already have an account set up, there is no need to open a new one. Just use some common sense to ensure that your username and avatar are work-appropriate. 

As an added layer of security, you may want to [enable two-factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/security), or 2FA. More information on 2FA is available [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).

### Joining DCgov on GitHub

To join the [DCgov](https://github.com/dcgov) organization on Github, send opensource@dc.gov an email containing your GitHub username from your official DC Government email address.

Then, join the relevant project or agency team(s) by requesting access from each team's maintainer. If there is no team that meets your needs, feel free to create a new one. All teams should have a self-explanatory name, a brief description, and be visible by default.

Team members may have given read, write, or administrative permissions to their team's repositories.

Individuals other than DC Government staff and contractors may be added as 'outside collaborators' to individual repositories on a case-by-case basis and with confirmation from opensource@dc.gov.
