### Setting Up a GitHub Account

Start out by [creating a free account](https://github.com/join) on GitHub. If you have used GitHub in the past and already have an account set up, there is no need to open a new one. Just make sure that your username and avatar are work-appropriate. 

As an added layer of security, you may want to [enable two-factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/security), or 2FA. More information on 2FA is available [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).

### Joining DCgov on GitHub

Become a member of the [DCgov organization](https://github.com/dcgov) by emailing your GitHub username to opensource@dc.gov from your official DC government email address. You can then join the relevant project or agency team(s) by requesting access from each team's maintainer. If you do not see a team that meets your needs, feel free to create a new one. All teams should have a self-explanatory name, a brief description, and be visible by default.
