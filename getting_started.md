The District is piloting a coordinated approach to open source development. The goal is to establish a shared home and governance model for all agencies' open source projects, with enough flexibility to support diverse agency and project needs. We expect to see decreased development costs, increased public engagement, and greater cross-agency collaboration as a result.

This guide is designed to help quickly onboard new users into the pilot. As teams join in, their feedback will be incorporated here. Assuming that the pilot is successful, a formal policy and expanded guidelines will be developed and the open source program will be officially launched.

The pilot and eventual program will enable DC Government to:

* Use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), which is software that does not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code, in our projects and contribute back to the open source community.
* Develop our work in the open, enabling public feedback and collaboration throughout the development lifecycle.
* Contribute code to open source projects maintained by third parties, such as other municipalities.


### Github 101

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a free web service built on top of the open source versioning tool Git. We have set up [DCgov](https://github.com/dcgov) as an organization on on Github to serve as the home for DC Government projects.

Any DC government staff member or authorized contractor can (and is encouraged to) become a member by setting up a Github account and requesting access.

A good getting started guide for Github is available [here](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/03/03/how-to-use-github-and-the-terminal-a-guide/) and a hands on tutorial can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

You can also set up a training session with the Innovation team by [emailing us](mailto:opensource@dc.gov).


### Setting Up a GitHub Account

Start out by [creating a free account](https://github.com/join) on GitHub. If you have used GitHub in the past and already have an account set up, there is no need to open a new one. Just use some common sense to ensure that your username and avatar are work-appropriate. If you are using a pre-existing GitHub you should also add your dc.gov email address to your profile.

As an added layer of security, you may want to [enable two-factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/security), or 2FA. More information on 2FA is available [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).

### Joining DCgov on GitHub

To join the [DCgov](https://github.com/dcgov) organization on Github, send [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov) an email containing your GitHub username from your official DC Government email address.

Once you're added to the organization, join the relevant project or agency team(s) by requesting access from each team's maintainer. If there is no team that meets your needs, feel free to create a new one. All teams should have a self-explanatory name, a brief description, and be visible by default.

Team members may be granted read, write, or administrative permissions to their team's repositories.

Individuals other than DC Government staff and contractors may be added as 'outside collaborators' to individual repositories on a case-by-case basis and with confirmation from [opensource@dc.gov](mailto:opensource@dc.gov)

For more information on permissions management, see [the policy](open-source-guidelines/policy.html).
