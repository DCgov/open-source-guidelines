### Setting Up a GitHub Account

Start out by [creating a free account](https://github.com/join) on GitHub. If you have used GitHub in the past and already have an account set up, there is no need to open a new one. Just use some common sense to ensure that your username and avatar are work-appropriate. 

As an added layer of security, you may want to [enable two-factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/security), or 2FA. More information on 2FA is available [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/).

### Joining DCgov on GitHub

[DCgov](https://github.com/dcgov) is the home for DC Government projects on GitHub. Any DC government staff member or authorized contractor with a GitHub account can become a member. To join, send opensource@dc.gov an email containing your GitHub username from your official DC Government email address.

Then, join the relevant project or agency team(s) by requesting access from each team's maintainer. If there is no team that meets your needs, feel free to create a new one. All teams should have a self-explanatory name, a brief description, and be visible by default.

Team members may have given read, write, or administrative permissions to their team's repositories.

Individuals other than DC Government staff and contractors may be added as 'outside collaborators' to individual repositories on a case-by-case basis and with confirmation from opensource@dc.gov.
